\section{Ada}

ADA was a cool language because it was designed from the ground-up to solve
a particular problem--it wasn't designed by people thinking big thoughts
in a committee, but by people hired to do a job.
So it was really well-specified. One manual for the spec, one manual for the
interpretation.
