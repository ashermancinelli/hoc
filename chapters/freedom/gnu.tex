\section{GNU}

There were loads of small companies that made money leasing out their compilers,
and GNU put them all out of business essentially overnight.
Every hardware company wrote their own compilers, but once it became clear
that just adding a backend for the GNU compiler would be significantly easier
than writing a new compiler from scratch, many of the hundreds of small compiler
companies went out of business, and the compiler teams inside large companies
began using and contributing to the GNU compilers.
