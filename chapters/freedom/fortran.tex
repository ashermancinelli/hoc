\section{Fortran}

We have already discussed Fortran in detail in the previous section;
we will continue to discuss Fortran's impact in every section.
Of the first programming languages, Fortran and Lisp have had the
most longevity, and Fortran programs tend to do more work today than
Lisp programs, in general.
Many critical applications in science and engineering are written in Fortran,
and Lisp, while it is still around and used in some contexts, is not
nearly as widely used.
