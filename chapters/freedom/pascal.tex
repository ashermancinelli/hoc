\section{Pascal}

Nicolas Writh wrote the language based on ALGOL 60.
He was heavily involved in the development of ALGOL X, or ALGOL 68 as it came to be known.
His proposal for ALGOL X was not taken up by the committee after they determined
that \todo{what's his name again?} would move forward with his W-grammar, and the
ALGOL 68 process divulged into complexity and political back-and-forths.
Wirth picked up his proposal and continued developing it until it became Pascal.

Runtime checking. tagged pointers and objects had tags such that if the tags didn't
match you would get a runtime error. If your program compiled and didn't get any
runtime errors, your program was probably correct.

pascal started as teaching, couldn't do anything with it.
then they made modula to make it usable.
omsi pascal named after our own omsi in oregon.
