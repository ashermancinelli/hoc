\section{Should Your Language Be Typed?}

When Lamport et al. (\citetitle{lamport_should_lang_be_typed_1999})
presented on these concepts, people were so offended - Backus's
position in \citetitle{backus_can_liberated_from_vn_style_1978} had gained lots of
influence in some circles, so the suggestion that we should \textit{regress} into a
less structured programming language was antithetical.

If you look at the programming languages that would reign for the decades to come
however, you might end up agreeing with Lamport.
Python and C and JavaScript have been seeing more and more adoption in spite
of their (lack of) type systems.
