\section{Pascal}
\label{sec:pascal}

Runtime checking. tagged pointers and objects had tags such that if the tags didn't
match you would get a runtime error (like the lisp machines).
If your program compiled and didn't get any
runtime errors, your program was probably correct.

pascal started as teaching, couldn't do anything with it.
then they made modula to make it usable.
omsi pascal named after our own omsi in oregon.
