The following sections will feature many of the same figures;
here we will introduce them so their interleaving stories may be told
uninterrupted in the following sections.

\subsection{Doug McIlroy, Joined 1958}

McIlroy became head of the Computing Techniques Research department in 1965, and he's regarded
as one of the most brilliant members of the staff by key members that readers may be more familiar with.
He hired Alfred Aho in 1967\cite{aho_oral_history_2022}:

\begin{quotation}
I was interviewed by a department head by the name of Doug McIlroy. He was an applied
mathematician from MIT. He had been at Bell Labs for a few years before me. Amongst other things, he
had co-invented macros for programming languages and he's also in this class of one of the smartest
people I've ever met.
\end{quotation}

He is described by nearly everyone at the Bell Labs Computing Research Center
(who wrote or spoke about their time there)
as the most brilliant member of that team that no one has heard of
\cite{kernighan_interviews_thompson_2019}; Ken Thompson described him as
"the smartest one of all of us and the least remembered or written down of all of us."
