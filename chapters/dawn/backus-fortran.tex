\section{IBM's Compilers}

There were several compiler efforts going on at IBM in this time period;
the primary topic of this section is John Backus and his work on FORTRAN.
FORTRAN was IBM's answer for scientific computing, but given their namesake
(\textit{International Business Machines}), they also had business users
who did not necessarily have the same interests as members of the scientific
computing community did.
