PL/1 used in the development of the Amber OS
\parencite{frankston_amber_os_bach_thesis_pastel_compiler_mit_1984}.

\begin{quotation}
	PL/I was chosen as the programming language in 1964. Other
	possibilities were a port of MAD (the Michigan Algorithm Display) or a
	port of AED-0 (an MIT display). The full PL/I language was harder to
	implement than expected. A contract was awarded to an outside firm
	to produce a PL/I compiler, and BTL administered the contract. The
	contractor assigned two people and had produced no compiler a year
	later. Bob Morris and Doug Mcllroy (at BTL) created a back-up plan for
	a PL/I compiler, using McClure's TMG language on the 7094.
	This language was called EPL (Early PL/I).
