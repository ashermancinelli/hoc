\section{Influential Interpreters}

Some early programming languages were initially interpreted,
but would go on to heavily influence compilers and programming language design
later on. We will introduce them here even though the payoff will not come until
later chapters.

\subsection{APL}

APL, standing for \textit{A Programming Language}, was developed by Kenneth E. Iverson in 1962
and partially implemented on the IBM System/360 as APL/360.
While this partial implementation was only an interpreter for a subset of the language Iverson
designed, it would spur on the development of a family of programming languages
called \textit{array programming languages} or \textit{Iversonian languages}.

\subsection{Lisp}

Started in 1958:  \citetitle{mccarthy_history_of_lisp_1978}.
