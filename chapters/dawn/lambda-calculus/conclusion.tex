\subsection{From the Theoretical to the Practical}

At this point in our history, \lam was primarily a theoretical tool used in academia,
the exception being McCarthy's work on Lisp, which was still not
nearly as pragmatic a programming language as FORTRAN, for instance.
In the \cref{sec:type-theory}, we will explore how these theories made their way
out of academia and strict mathematics into the more practical realm of programming languages
and compilers.
