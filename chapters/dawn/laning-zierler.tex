\label{sec:laning-zierler}

Of the early compiler efforts, Laning and Zierler's team is perhaps the most overshadowed.
Their contemporaries were very impressed by their work, and they inspired a number
of innovations at Remington Rand and IBM.
Backus described the pseudocode compilers of the time (such as the A-2)
as merely providing an instruction set
slightly different from the machine's actual code, but not providing any real abstraction;
writing the pseudocode still tedious and unproductive.
Laning and Zierler's work was different.

  \textbf{5. The Priesthood versus the Laning and Zierler Algebraic Compiler}
  Very early in the 1950s, J. Halcombe Laning, Jr., recognized that
  programming using algebraic expressions would be an important improvement.
  As a result of that insight he and Neal Zierler had the first
  algebraic compiler
  running on WHIRLWIND at MIT in January 1954 [3]. (A private
    communication from the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory indicates
    that they had
  demonstrated algebraic compiling sometime in 1952!) The priesthood
  ignored Laning's insight for a long time. A 1954 article by Charles W. Adams
  and Laning (presented by Adams at the ONR symposium) devotes less than
  3 out of 28 pages to Laning's algebraic system; the rest are devoted to other
  MIT systems. The complete description of the system's method of operation
  as given there is the following

  In retrospect, the biggest event of the 1954 symposium on automatic
  programming
  was the announcement of a system that J. Halcombe Laning, Jr. and Niel Zierler
  had recently implemented for the Whirlwind computer at M.I.T.  However, the
  significance of that announcement is not especially evident from the published
  proceedings [NA 524-], 97\% of which are devoted to enthusiastic description s
  of assemblers, interpreters, and 1954-style "compilers".

  The first programming system to operate in the sense of a modern compiler was
  developed by J. H. Laning and N. Zierler for the Whirlwind computer at the
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the early 1950s. They described their
  system, which never had a name, in an elegant and terse manual entitled "A
  Program for Translation of Mathematical Equations for Whirlwind I,"
  distributed
  by MIT to about one-hundred locations in January 1954.26 It was, in John
  Backus's words, "an elegant concept elegantly realized." Unlike the UNIVAC
  compilers, this system worked much as modern compilers work; that is, it took
  as its input commands entered by a user, and generated as output fresh and
  novel machine code, which not only executed those commands but also kept track
  of storage locations, handled repetitive loops, and did other housekeeping
  chores. Laning and Zierler's "Algebraic System" took commands typed
  in familiar
  algebraic form and translated them into machine codes that Whirlwind could
  execute.27 (There was still some ambiguity as to the terminology: while Laning
    and Zierler used the word "translate" in the title of their manual, in the
  Abstract they call it an "interpretive program.")28
