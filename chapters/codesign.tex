\begin{quotation}
But there are still lots of interesting open problems left and one of the most intriguing aspects of
compiler design is can we use AI, machine learning, and large language models like GPT-3 to create
code automatically from written or spoken specifications. That's still an unfolding story and I'm not willing
to trust any program created by an AI program at this point. I wouldn't want it in my pacemaker. I wouldn't
want it in my self-driving car or in my airplane. But maybe for a computer game, it's okay. This is what
they're creating with these at this time. So even the area of programming language translation is
undergoing new approaches and how successful they will be is yet to be determined.
