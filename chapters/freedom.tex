The discussion of the GNU/Linux 
operating system and the "open source" softwaremovement, discussed last, 
likewise has deep roots. Chapter 3 discussed thefounding of SHARE, as well as 
the controversy over who was allowed to use andmodify the TRAC programming 
language. GNU/Linux is a variant of UNIX, a systemdeveloped in the late 1960s 
and discussed at length in several earlier chaptersof this book. UNIX was an 
open system almost from the start, although not quiteinthe ways that "open" is 
defined now. As with the antitrust trial againstMicrosoft, the open source 
software movement has a strong tie to the beginningsof the personal computer's 
invention. Early actions by Microsoft and itsfounders played an important role 
here as well. We begin with the 
antitrusttrial.\cite{history_of_modern_computing_2003_ceruzzi}

Key 
innovation is that LLVM is a collection of compiler \textit{libraries} that 
havethin programs wrapping them.Other open-source compilers like GCC tend to be 
monolithic programs, which canbe harder to compose.LLVM contains a collection 
of sub-projects that can be used independently as tools\textit{or libraries}; 
key examples being the LLVM subproject of LLVM itself(which contains LLVM IR, 
the intermediate representation, the optimizer, interpreter and code 
generator)and Clang, a C/C++/Objective-C compiler front-end for LLVM.Any other 
compiler project could emit LLVM IR and fully leverage the LLVM project after 
the front-end.LLVM's intermediate representation has become the lingua-franca 
of the compiler world.

From its beginning in December 2000, 
LLVM was designed as a set of reusablelibraries with well-defined interfaces 
[LA04]. At the time, open sourceprogramming language implementations were 
designed as special-purpose toolswhich usually had monolithic executables. For 
example, it was very difficult toreuse the parser from a static compiler (e.g., 
GCC) for doing static analysisor refactoring. While scripting languages often 
provided a way to embed theirruntime and interpreter into larger applications, 
this runtime was a singlemonolithic lump of code that was included or excluded. 
There was no way toreuse pieces, and very little sharing across language 
implementation projects.\cite{aosa_vol1}

The 
name "LLVM" was once an acronym, but is now just a brand for the 
umbrellaproject. While LLVM provides some unique capabilities, and is known for 
some ofits great tools (e.g., the Clang compiler2, a C/C++/Objective-C compiler 
whichprovides a number of benefits over the GCC compiler), the main thing that 
setsLLVM apart from other compilers is its internal 
architecture.\cite[LLVM]{aosa_vol1}

Lattner published his thesis 
on LLVM in 2002, and joined Apple in 
2005.
