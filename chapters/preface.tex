\chapterstar{Preface}

There have been several monumentous works on the history of computing and a few on
the history of programming languages, but in the two and a half decades since the turn
of the century there have been ample developments in compiler technology that
no comprehensive work has covered thus far.
This book aims to fill that gap to a small degree; it is not exhaustive, but
contextualizes many of the most important recent developments in the larger
narrative of compiler history.

% The introduction chapter contains a brief version of the entire book; the reader is encouraged to read it first.
My hope is that each chapter stands on its own, but that reading them in order will give a more complete picture.
The reader ought to be able to read a particular chapter that suits their needs at the time.
This book does not assume the reader is deeply familiar with compiler engineering or computer science.

The book is structured as a chronological narrative of the history of compilers
without prioritizing any particular company or compiler.
