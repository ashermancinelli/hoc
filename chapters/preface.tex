\chapter{Preface}

The introduction chapter contains a brief version of the entire book; the reader is encouraged to read it first.
My hope is that each chapter stands on its own, but that reading them in order will give a more complete picture.
The reader ought to be able to read a particular chapter that suits their needs at the time.
This book does not assume the reader is deeply familiar with compiler engineering or computer science.

The book is structured as a chronological narrative of the history of compilers
without focusing too much on any particular company or compiler.
