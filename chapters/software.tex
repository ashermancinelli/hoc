\section{The Next 700 Programming Languages}

Published in \citeyear{landin_next_700_prog_langs_1966},
Peter Landin's seminal paper \citetitlecite{landin_next_700_prog_langs_1966} lays out his vision for
the future of programming language design, emphasizing the importance of the programmer's intent
uncluttered by details of the hardware.
He argued that the programmer ought to only consider their intent, and the compiler ought to
consider the operations that would be needed to carry out their intent.

The paper describes a new programming language called IYSWIM, for \textit{If You See What I Mean}.

	The CDC 160 and the Origins of the Minicomputer

	The Whirlwind (a computer prototype built at
	MIT) had a word length of only 16 bits, but the story of commercial minicomputers really begins with
	an inventor associated with very large computers: Seymour Cray. While at UNIVAC Cray worked on the
	Navy Tactical Data System (NTDS), a computer designed for navy ships and one of the first
	transistorized machines produced in quantity. Around 1960 Control Data, the company founded in 1957
	that Cray joined, introduced its model 1604, a large computer intended for scientific customers.
	Shortly thereafter CDC introduced the 160, designed

\section{The DEC VAX and the IBM System/360}
\begin{quotation}
	Through the 1980s the dominant mainframe architecture continues to be a descendent of the IBM
	System/360, while the dominant mini was the DEC VAX, which evolved as a 32 bit extension of the
	16-bit PDP-11.
