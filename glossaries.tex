}

\newglossaryentry{ub}{
	name={undefined behavior},

\newglossaryentry{ftn}{
	name={Fortran},
	description={The Fortran programming language, standing for \textit{FORmula TRANslator}. Most renditions of the name of the programming language have only the first letter capitalized (\textit{Fortran}), however early versions were rendered as \textit{FORTRAN}. We attempt to use the proper name for each time period. \textit{Fortran} came to be used after the 1990 edition of the standard, while the 1977 standard and all prior versions were rendered as \textit{FORTRAN}}

\newglossaryentry{inducvar}{
	name={induction variable},
	description={A variable changes by some constant in each iteration of a loop. In \texttt{for (int i=0; i < n; i++)}, the variable \texttt{i} is an induction variable}

\newglossaryentry{constant-folding}{
	name={constant folding},
	description={Optimization that replaces an expression with a constant value if the expression's value can be determined at compile time. For example, the expression \texttt{2 + 3} can be replaced with \texttt{5} by the compiler so it need not be calculated by the final program}

	description={TODO}
}

\newglossaryentry{translation-unit}{
	name={translation unit},
	description={A component of a program being compiled such that the compiler has access to all the information contained in the component during compilation. For C, C++ and Fortran code, a translation unit typically corresponds to a single source file which is compiled to an object file before being linked into a program or library. Some compilers always treat the entire program as a single translation unit, like the original FORTRAN compiler or the Zig compiler}

\newglossaryentry{backedge}{
	name={back-edge},
	description={A back-edge is an edge in the \acrshort{cfg} that returns execution from the end of a loop body back to the beginning of the loop, or the loop's \gls{header-cfg}}
}

\newglossaryentry{header-cfg}{
	name={header},
	description={A header is the first node in a control-flow graph of a loop. Loops begin execution at the entry node, then to the header node, then through the loop body node(s), and finally they either take the \gls{backedge} back to the start of the loop, or they exit the loop}
}

\newglossaryentry{r-value}{
	name={r-value},
	description={An value that can be stored to an address. Read as "a value that may occur on the right-hand side of an assignment." In most programming languages, l-values may act as r-values, but not all r-values may act as l-values. The variable \texttt{foo} may occur on either side of an assignment, but there is little sense in the number \texttt{5} being assigned a value}
}

\newglossaryentry{l-value}{
	name={l-value},
	description={An addressable value that another value can be stored to. Read as "a value that may occur on the left-hand side of an assignment"}

\newglossaryentry{dynamic-binding}{
	name={dynamic binding},
	description={Variable scoping semantics where the value of a variable is determined by the value the variable name corresponds to in the program's environment when the value is used.}
}

\newglossaryentry{call-by-name}{
	name={call-by-name},
	description={Function calling semantics where the argument's expression is evaluated \textit{each time it is used} in the body of the function. Contrast this with \gls{call-by-value} and \gls{dynamic-binding}}
}

\newglossaryentry{call-by-value}{
	name={call-by-value},
	description={Function calling semantics where the argument's expression is evaluated \textit{once, before it is passed} to the body of the function. Contrast this with \gls{call-by-name} and \gls{dynamic-binding}. This is how most programming languages work}
}

\newglossaryentry{call-by-reference}{
	name={call-by-reference},
	description={Function calling semantics where the argument's address is passed in place of its value such that expressions and statements where the parameter occurs as an \gls{l-value} result in assignements to the variable's storage in the caller's scope}

\newglossaryentry{autovec}{
	name={automatic vectoriz},
	description={A process for leveraging \acrshort{simd} instructions where the compiler \textit{infers} the opportunities to exploit parallelism in the user's program. The user does not \textit{necessarily} have to change their program, but they can often benefit from it or provide compiler flags or preprocessor directives to explicitly request it}
}

\newglossaryentry{peephole}{
	name={peephole optimization},
	description={Sometimes called a \textit{peep}, this kind of transformation typically
			traverses the entire program searching for a small pattern that can be simplified or otherwise
			transformed in a beneficial way}

	name={profile-guided optimization},
	description={Compiler optimizations that take advantage of statistics from the execution of a program to improve the compiler's heuristics.
